# 4D CLI component: THINK / ASK → RUN playbook

This is the canonical implementation and acceptance guide. Read `README.md`,
`template.json`, this file, class documentation, relevant scripts and host tests
before editing. This is a **real 4D component**, not a native 4D plug-in: its
bundled executable runs as a separate process. Keep generic execution separate
from the deliberate feature API.

Repository-wide Copilot instructions are intentionally short. The optional
task-specific skill is `.github/skills/4d-cli-component/SKILL.md`; its presence
does not prove that a particular agent session discovered or invoked it.

## 1. THINK / ASK: establish the contract before running

Resolve these inputs from the request and actual destination repository. Ask
only for missing decisions that affect identity, semantics, dependencies or
release scope; do not ask for imaginary license/signing prerequisites. In
non-interactive execution, document safe assumptions; stop rather than guess
the destination identity or the user's language.

| Decision | Required answer / check |
| --- | --- |
| Destination | Exact GitHub `owner/name`, including basename **case**; inspect the actual remote, not the checkout/worktree directory |
| Language | One user-selected `go`, `rust` or `cpp`; never ship three implementations |
| Namespace | Independent, unique 4D identifier; syntax validation cannot prove uniqueness among a host's future components |
| CLI | Lowercase executable basename, not a path |
| Feature | API class/methods, input/output, versioned CLI protocol, errors, limits, timeout and concurrency semantics |
| Dependencies | Pins, lockfiles, upstream licenses and redistribution notices, including statically linked runtime/stdlib |
| Acceptance | Native platforms available now; real source/compiled host checks; local unsigned artifact versus approved publication |

### Identity is exact, namespace is independent

The destination basename MUST equal `template.json.repository`,
`package.json.name`, `component/<name>`, `Project/<name>.4DProject`, catalog
`<base name>`, packed `<name>.4DZ`, outer `<name>.4dbase` and release
`<name>.zip`. Preserve case even on case-insensitive filesystems. CLI identity
and feature class identity are separate from this equality.

`settings.4DSettings` is XML:
`general.component_classStore_name` controls the host namespace.
For example, repository `hello-tools`, namespace `AcmeHello` and class `Greeting`
produce `cs.AcmeHello.Greeting` in a host; component-internal code uses
`cs.Greeting`, **not** the host namespace. Do not invent an exported-class list:
the namespace shares component classes. Underscore names are internal
**by convention**, not access control.

### Scope and stop rules

* Do not initialize `miyako/4d-component-template` itself, even when a worktree
  has a different local name. Template maintenance/documentation is not adoption.
* Never set `initialized` by hand, bypass initializer validation, overwrite a
  conflicting initialized destination or silently choose another language.
* A feature description is not an implementation. Renaming a class is not
  replacing its behavior. Do not declare completion while greetings remain
  in the feature contract, smoke tests or completion metadata.
* Inspect tool reports before installing anything. Missing selected toolchains
  are failures/blocked checks, not silently skipped successes.
* Stop on identity mismatch, unsafe archive paths, stale/mixed build artifacts,
  unavailable required runtime, compile errors or failed package-host loading.
  Return partial evidence and the precise blocker; do not weaken gates.
* Do not create tables, authentication/locale settings, setup actions or PDF
  algorithms merely to resemble a reference project.
* Do not publish, push tags, add signing/account settings or copy credentials
  unless the user authorized that scope. Local acceptance needs none of them.

## 2. RUN: inspect and initialize only the destination

Start with a read-only environment/configuration report:

```sh
python3 scripts/doctor.py --root .
python3 scripts/doctor.py --root . --tool4d /path/to/tool4d
```

`doctor.py` reports JSON configuration, Python minimum compatibility, selected
installed tools, host and supplied executable; it does not initialize,
download, build, repair permissions or claim runtime acceptance. `--tool4d` is
optional. Review the actual remote and script `--help` before invoking mutating
steps. Paths passed via `--root` must identify the intended repository.

For a **new destination** with `template.json.initialized:false`:

```sh
python3 scripts/initialize.py --root . --repository hello-tools \
  --namespace AcmeHello --cli hello-cli --language go \
  --feature "The requested feature"
```

Obtain the destination identity with `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq
.nameWithOwner` (read-only), or inspect its GitHub remote. Never use the worktree
directory basename. An example **adopter prompt**, not a specialization of this
template, is:

> In this new GitHub repository named UuidTest, implement UUIDv7 using Go,
> namespace UuidTest, CLI uuid-test and public class UUIDv7. Follow AGENTS.md;
> initialize first, replace the greeting API/CLI/docs/contracts/host tests,
> define RFC 9562 timestamp/version/variant and entropy-error behavior, and
> deliver the actual compiled package. Do not promise monotonic ordering across
> fresh CLI processes or mathematical uniqueness from a finite sample. Report
> all untested native platforms, signing and dependency-manager installation.

The initializer validates/stages identity rewrites, renames the component root,
project/catalog and deterministic catalog UUID, XML namespace, CLI manifests,
package metadata, README/class examples and host fixtures. It retains only the
selected starter in `cli/`, removes `cli-starters/`, preserves binary icons and
marks initialization complete. Identical repetition is a no-op; conflicting
reconfiguration is rejected. It invokes **no toolchain** and records the feature
description only. You must implement the feature next. Unconfigured template CI
must neither publish nor install every language toolchain.
Do not subsequently copy original template fixtures over the configured
`tests/host/`: doing so restores the old namespace and can make the host's
feature constructor undefined. Preserve the initializer's rewritten files when
copying additional tests or tooling.

Current syntax limits: repository 1–80 ASCII letters/digits/underscore/hyphen,
starting with a letter/digit; namespace 1–31 identifier characters starting with
a letter; CLI 1–63 lowercase letters/digits/hyphens starting with a letter.
Reserved names and control characters are rejected by the initializer.

## 3. RUN: replace the greeting feature completely

Define the versioned CLI contract and error/status behavior first. For a new
class identity, the helper performs a bounded **identity rewrite**, not feature
implementation:

```sh
python3 scripts/rename_feature.py --root . --class UUIDv7
```

It rewrites the Greeting identity only in known files and records
`template.json.feature_class`;
do not use global search-and-replace across arbitrary user files. Inspect its
diff and then implement the methods/protocol. A class named `UUIDv7` that still
returns a greeting is unfinished.
In the exact known `.4dm` files it changes class-reference code outside Text
strings and `//` comments; known docs/README identity references are rewritten
separately. User literals/comments and arbitrary files are not a rename target.

### Feature replacement inventory

Update these surfaces together, preserving reusable infrastructure:

1. `cli/` implementation, selected-language tests, usage/version/error messages
   and dependency manifests/lockfiles. Exactly one language remains.
2. `Project/Sources/Classes/Greeting.4dm` (or renamed feature class): constructor,
   public methods, internal decode validation and feature-specific result schema.
3. `Documentation/Classes/<Feature>.md` and related helper contracts if changed.
4. `tests/host/Project/Sources/Methods/Smoke.4dm`: real namespaced feature calls,
   assertions, negative cases and `Is compiled mode` evidence. Update
   `tests/host/contract.json` alongside it; the Python runner consumes this
   schema-1 feature/execution contract rather than hardcoding greeting results.
5. `tests/test_cli.py`, `tests/cli-contract.json` vectors consumed by native
   build smoke tests in `scripts/build_cli.py`, Python host-report checks in
   `scripts/test_4d.py` and relevant regression tests. Do not leave a contract
   expecting `greet` after changing the executable.
6. README host examples/CLI contract, `template.json.feature` and any feature
   `template.json.feature_class` registry used by the rename helper. Keep
   version metadata and `package.json` aligned. This starter deliberately ties
   its bundled CLI version to the component version; an independently versioned
   third-party CLI need not share that version. Define and assert both contracts
   explicitly rather than blindly rewriting upstream versions.
7. Compiler-generated `Resources/en.lproj/syntaxEN.json`: regenerate through the
   actual compiler and verify the new class appears; never retain stale Greeting
   completion metadata.
8. Redistribution notices under `component/<name>/Resources/licenses/`, and the
   committed custom icons only if the feature requires artwork changes.

Keep `_CLI`, `_Process` and `_CaptureError` generic. Feature validators and
algorithms belong in feature classes/CLI, not the process adapter. Add exact
vectors, malformed input, failure injection and bounded performance tests.
For randomized/clock-dependent features, document ordering/state/collision
limitations and distinguish empirical samples from guarantees.

### Host contract registry

`tests/host/contract.json` separates feature expectations from generic execution
checks. `feature.casesPath` is a JSON pointer (initially `/cases`), and
`feature.cases` declares exact expected `stdout`, `stderr`, `exitCode` and decoded
`value` fields. Replace the greeting expectations with the feature's real cases.
For nondeterministic output, add appropriate real host semantic checks and use
the registry's supported assertions rather than pretending random output is a
fixed vector; extend validation deliberately if the contract cannot express
the feature.
For that mode, omit exact `feature.cases`, set positive integer
`feature.caseCount`, and supply nonempty `feature.caseAssertions` applied to
every complete result. Do not specify both modes. A `matches` assertion performs
a full Text regex match, not a substring search; e.g. check the identifier's
version/variant grammar while separately asserting host-measured clock bounds,
count or other semantic facts. Both modes still require complete non-null
feature values, exact count, finished/mode flags and nonempty failure assertions.

Both `feature.assertions` and `execution.assertions` use JSON-pointer `path`
with `equals`, `matches`, `length`, nested `each`, or `absent:true`. An empty pointer addresses
the current value; nested `each` assertions are relative to each item.
Escape pointer tokens with `~1` for slash and `~0` for tilde. `equals` uses
strict JSON type/deep equality; `length` is an exact array count, `each` requires
a nonempty array, and `absent:true` must appear with only `path`. Both assertion
arrays must be nonempty.
`execution.successPaths` names successful process envelopes: these do not require
feature-decoded `value`. Preserve separate generic resource/launch/type/NUL/path
checks when replacing the feature cases. Never make the fixture self-approve
without runner-side validation.

The runner always requires fresh `success:true`, `finished:true` and exact
compiled mode (`false` for source, `true` for the unpacked compiled artifact).
Feature cases must be nonempty, successful and have nonempty Text stdout, Text
stderr, integer exitCode zero and non-null decoded value. Exit status,
diagnostics and feature output remain separately asserted.
Write `finished:true` only at the actual end of Smoke. Change feature cases,
negative assertions and feature-specific File/Folder round-trip invocations
together; preserve nine unsupported argument types, leading/middle/trailing NUL,
Null required inputs, missing resource, unsupported target and launch-failure
coverage. Do not edit the runner to hardcode a feature class, case count or messages.

### Native CLI contract vectors

`tests/cli-contract.json` contains `schema:1` and nonempty `cases`. Each case has
Text-array `args`, integer `exitCode`, and exact expected `stdout`/`stderr`.
Streams are either literal Text encoded as UTF-8 or JSON Objects serialized
compactly as UTF-8 plus LF; `$VERSION` in expected JSON is substituted from
configuration. Include at least one real feature-success vector and one
nonzero-status failure vector, not merely `--version`. These vectors replace
the old hardcoded greeting smoke expectations. Language/Python tests and real
4D host assertions remain independent required evidence.
For nondeterministic streams, use a nonempty `stdoutPattern` or `stderrPattern`
**instead of** that exact stream field. It must fully match strict UTF-8 output,
including expected framing/LF. A grammar match alone is not a timestamp,
entropy, ordering or collision guarantee; the feature's native tests and real
host semantic checks must verify those separately. This avoids rewriting the
generic build/host runner merely to accommodate random output.

## 4. Real 4D process and error rules

* `_CLI` resolves the component's `/RESOURCES/bin` only: no PATH fallback,
  runtime download or unchecked chmod. Expand virtual paths with `platformPath`
  and the correct `File(...; fk platform path)` / `Folder(...)` constructors.
  A Python-supplied macOS path in a JSON request is POSIX: construct it with
  `File(path; fk posix path)`; on Windows use `fk platform path`. This is not the
  same as a 4D object's `.platformPath`, which requires `fk platform path` on
  either OS. The real renamed-executable host test exercises this distinction.
* `4D.SystemWorker.new` takes **command-line Text**, not an argv Collection.
  The generic adapter may accept a Collection but must quote each literal into
  Text. SystemWorker does not implicitly invoke a shell. Never introduce
  `cmd /c`, `bash -c`, `eval` or unquoted user paths/arguments.
* Use the existing quote routine, not shell escaping. macOS and Windows CRT
  backslash/quote parsing need **real 4D** native round trips on both OSes.
* Guard `Value type` before `OB Instance of`: numeric, Boolean, Null, date/time
  and Collection values must be rejected before object-instance checks. Plain
  Objects also fail; only Text, File and Folder arguments are supported.
* Reject actual embedded NUL with **strict** `Position(Char(0); $argument; *)>0`.
  The `*` matters: default linguistic comparison is not a byte/character-exact
  NUL search. Test ordinary Unicode/spaces and an actual NUL separately.
* The real options are `dataType:"text"`, `encoding:"UTF-8"`, `hideWindow:true`,
  `timeout:30`, `currentDirectory:file.parent`. Close stdin with `.closeInput()`,
  then `.wait()`. Read `.response`, `.responseError`, `.exitCode` and `.errors`
  separately; do not invent setup actions or architecture properties.
* A nonempty stderr is not itself failure. Missing/undefined exitCode, launch
  failure, timeout/abnormal exit, system errors, nonzero status and malformed
  protocol are failures. Preserve available stdout/stderr/status and diagnostic
  details; prelaunch failures must not invent an exit code.
* Capture errors narrowly with `ON ERR CALL(...; ek local)`, restore
  `Method called on error(ek local)` immediately and retain `Last errors`.
  Never install a permanent host-global handler or use Null/empty success
  fallbacks. Feature JSON parsing must reject wrong type/version/fields.
  4D Boolean expressions do not safely short-circuit type-sensitive operations:
  validate `Value type(payload.protocol)` in a separate `If` before comparing
  its numeric protocol version. Do not combine the guard and comparison with OR.
* Native Windows target is explicitly `Windows-x64`; never infer CPU
  architecture from freeform processor names. Native Windows ARM64 is unsupported.
* This starter is synchronous, with a finite 30-second timeout. Async work needs
  `CALL WORKER`, a live worker process, isolated per-call state, cancellation
  queue clearing and context pruning. Do not retrofit a shared unsafe PID map.
  `New process` is not a substitute for the callback/worker lifetime requirement.
  Do not infer stdin input from every `-` argument: it may denote an output.
* Use UTF-8 explicitly. Binary protocols need a separate deliberate Blob mode.
  Never blindly write empty stdout to an output file.

Keep tokens in IDE-generated code; plain command names in this scaffold are
intentional and accepted by the compiler.

## 5. RUN: build and validate from the same source revision

Pin selected toolchains/dependencies; commit lockfiles where applicable. Review
upstream licenses before copying/bundling. No license activation or signing secret
is needed for **unsigned local tool4d component compilation**. This does not
waive redistribution notices or licensing for the IDE/Server/merged applications.

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 scripts/validate_icons.py
python3 scripts/build_cli.py --root . --target macos-arm64
```

Choose the actual native target: `macos-x64`, `macos-arm64`, `windows-x64`.
`build_cli.py` defaults to native-only; requesting another target without an
explicit supported cross flag must fail. For Go on a native macOS host only,
`python3 scripts/build_cli.py --root . --target windows-x64 --cross` produces a
foreign artifact without claiming native execution. Rust/C++ cross mode fails
explicitly. Build all
three native artifacts from the **same commit/input revision** for release.
Do not combine tracked stale binaries or artifacts from different commits.
Configured CI tests only the selected language and fails on missing tools.
Each executable is accompanied by `build/<target>/build-manifest.json`, binding
CLI source/config/package inputs, Git commit and binary SHA256. Native CI uploads
the manifest with the executable. Assembly refuses missing, stale, modified or
mixed-source manifests; a plausible filename/header alone is not provenance.
Preserve `.gitattributes`: LF text checkout on macOS **and Windows** keeps those
content hashes identical; automatic CRLF conversion would create different
inputs despite an identical Git commit.

Resource assembly requires both macOS slices and Windows x64:

```sh
python3 scripts/ci_config.py assemble --root .
```

The genuine lipo verification order is:
`lipo <universal-file> -verify_arch x86_64 arm64`, **not**
`lipo -verify_arch x86_64 arm64 <file>`. Create with
`lipo -create <intel-file> <arm-file> -output <universal-file>`.
Check native dynamic dependencies and preserve executable ZIP modes.

### Optional local orchestration, not a release shortcut

```sh
python3 scripts/accept_local.py --root . --repository OWNER/REPOSITORY \
  --tool4d /path/to/tool4d
```

Without `--cross`, this builds/tests the native target and requires already
current matching artifacts **and manifests for all three targets** for assembly.
For Rust/C++, obtain them from native CI for the exact same commit and source
inputs, restoring each executable and its `build-manifest.json` to
`build/<target>/`. Do not attempt unsupported cross mode.

For **Go on native macOS**, optional local three-target artifact production:

```sh
python3 scripts/accept_local.py --root . --repository OWNER/REPOSITORY \
  --tool4d /path/to/tool4d --cross
```

The acceptance helper invokes existing builds, assembly, source host tests,
compilation, packing/unpacking and compiled host tests. Read its `--help` and
`build/acceptance.json`; do not assume missing tools/platforms were tested.
Add `--cross` **only for Go** to build nonnative CLI artifacts locally. Rust/C++
cross mode is unsupported and must be reported explicitly, not silently ignored.
Go cross-compilation is optional artifact production, not native execution or
Windows/Intel 4D evidence. Neither the helper nor class renaming implements the
requested feature automatically.

On native Apple Silicon, `accept_local.py --cross` builds all three Go targets,
tests the native CLI and may separately run Intel CLI vectors through Rosetta
when available. Rosetta evidence is **translated execution**, not native Intel
execution or Intel 4D loading. If unavailable, that check remains `not_run`;
Windows native execution remains unverified regardless of successful cross-build.

Evidence is written to `build/acceptance.json`; a successful pack produces
`dist/<repository>.zip`. A partially validated local package is **NOT release
ready**, even if its source/compiled Apple Silicon host checks pass. Missing
required artifacts/checks can prevent ZIP creation; do not manufacture substitutes.
The helper preserves `build/source-host-status.json`,
`build/compiled-host-status.json` and `build/compile-status.json` separately.
Verified local package completion reports `result:"partial"`, `finished:true`,
`release_ready:false`; failure saves evidence with `result:"failed"` and
`finished:false`. `cli_build_<target>` and `cli_test_<target>` are distinct checks,
and Rosetta is separate. macOS `otool -L` checks allowlisted system libraries;
Windows native DLL/runtime dependencies are explicitly **not inspected locally**
and require native review.
The verified run also writes `dist/<repository>.acceptance.json` beside the ZIP,
including its SHA256, timestamps, actual tool4d version/hash and embedded host
reports. Copy that pair to durable storage before disposing of a worktree.
`build/acceptance.json` records the latest attempt, including failures; it is not
proof that a pre-existing ZIP was produced by a failed attempt.

## 6. Free fixed tool4d and real compiled-package acceptance

[tool4d](https://developer.4d.com/docs/20/Admin/cli#tool4d) is the official free
standalone headless tool. Do not bundle it in component Resources. This local
flow needs no serial, activation secret, signing identity or repository settings.
Use a fixed HTTPS archive and verify its SHA256 before extracting into `.tools/`:

```sh
python3 scripts/ci_config.py download-tool4d --root .
```

The command derives its fixed URL/hash from versioned `package.json.tool`.
Only for an explicitly approved override, pass the **complete** pair:

```sh
python3 scripts/ci_config.py download-tool4d --root . \
  --url https://resources-download.4d.com/release/20.x/20.7/101905/mac/tool4d_arm64.tar.xz \
  --sha256 40a5d177a4f73165f52abf6ec8000249d81411c41353ccf258cece8e74639261
```

This is **20.7 build 101905, macOS ARM64**, observed in the local case study.
It is not a native Intel/Windows tool or a future availability guarantee.
`latest` is mutable/discovery-only and must not be a pinned download input.
The approved default is recorded in `package.json.tool`. Paired explicit
`--url` / `--sha256` overrides take precedence over paired
`TOOL4D_URL` / `TOOL4D_SHA256` environment overrides, then the manifest default.
Supply both override values or neither; incomplete pairs fail. The explicit
fixed flags above make this local command independent of repository variables. Require
native-host compatibility and safe extraction: reject path traversal, escaping
symlink chains, unsupported entries and checksum mismatch. Never bypass checks.

Run the actual stages (example version `0.1.0`, initialized destination only):

```sh
python3 scripts/test_4d.py --root . --tool4d .tools/tool4d.app/Contents/MacOS/tool4d
python3 scripts/compile_component.py --root . --tool4d .tools/tool4d.app/Contents/MacOS/tool4d
python3 scripts/package_component.py --root . --repository OWNER/REPOSITORY \
  --tag v0.1.0 --unpack-test
python3 scripts/test_4d.py --root . --tool4d .tools/tool4d.app/Contents/MacOS/tool4d \
  --component build/release-test/REPOSITORY.4dbase
```

1. Source host tests load an isolated component through a real host's
   `Components/`. The local dependency path names the package root, not the anchor.
   Source staging drops DerivedData to avoid interpreted tests loading stale
   compiled code. Isolated host/request/status paths include Unicode, spaces and
   both quote characters on POSIX (quotes are invalid in Windows filenames);
   copies reject symlinks. A renamed copy of the actual native CLI also verifies
   executable-path handling, not merely argument quoting. These tests require actual
   runtime execution on each OS to establish native quoting behavior.
2. Run actual `Compile project` for `x86_64_generic` and `arm64_macOS_lib`.
   Require fresh successful JSON identifying the correct project/targets.
   A zero tool exit without that file is not compilation success.
3. Clear generated DerivedData before compiling and bind the compile marker to
   current inputs. Stale compiled state can be treated as sourceless by 4D.
   Require native Libraries and nonempty CompiledCode, not source-shaped stand-ins.
   `compile-status.json.input_sha256` binds the component inputs, and
   `output_sha256` also binds the generated DerivedData/Libraries. Packaging must
   reject altered/stale compiler outputs, not merely check their presence.
4. Pack deterministic ZIPs, strip all Classes/Methods `.4dm` source, retain
   compiler-generated completion metadata and external native Libraries.
   **Both ZIP levels need explicit nested directory records**: a generally valid
   ZIP omitting them caused an observed real compiled-component loader crash.
5. Test the **unpacked ZIP's** `.4dbase`, not the working source folder. The
   component must report `Is compiled mode=True`. A Python/CLI suite, successful
   compiler or archive structure check is not evidence of real host loading.
6. Recompile/repack/retest after any source/build input change. For the
   destination's staged post-package signing, preserve the pre-sign compile
   marker, record signed hashes separately and host-test the exact final ZIP
   as specified in section 8. Never accept a stale `host-status.json` or result
   describing a different package.

The isolated host's `Host_error` method writes raw `Last errors`, the failing
phase, `success:false` and `finished:false` on an unexpected runtime abort.
It uses/restores a local handler; it is not a permanent host-global component
handler. Inspect `build/host-status.json` before guessing that compilation,
namespace sharing or quoting is broken.

For template maintainers, this opt-in regression creates a disposable initialized
`UuidTest` / `UuidTest` / `uuid-test` Go fixture, renames the class to `Identifier`,
then executes the same local pipeline:

```sh
TOOL4D_INTEGRATION=.tools/tool4d.app/Contents/MacOS/tool4d \
  TEST_CLI_LANGUAGE=none python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_adoption.py -v
```

It preserves the initializer-renamed host fixture, exercises native and Go
cross-builds, real quoted/Unicode paths, source and final compiled host modes,
generated class metadata, stripped source, ZIP records/modes and artifact hash.
Evidence is saved in `build/adoption-evidence/` before fixture cleanup, including
failed status/phase reports. This is a starter identity/wiring regression,
**not** evidence that UUIDv7 or any other new feature was implemented.

`--tag` validates package/version identity; it does not create/push/publish a tag.
For approved hosted publication only, set Actions **variable**
`FOURD_ENABLED=true`; `TOOL4D_URL` / `TOOL4D_SHA256` are optional paired overrides
of the approved public `package.json.tool` pin, not required secrets. Push the matching
`v<version>` tag. Release jobs build same-tag native resources, compile after
assembly and host-test the unpacked package before publishing `<repository>.zip`.
Only publication receives built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` write permission; no personal
token/version-bot commit is required.

### Manual Actions dispatch and existing-tag release

After the dispatch-capable workflow is merged to the **default branch**, open
**Actions → CI → Run workflow** and select a branch for ordinary validation.
`FOURD_ENABLED` still controls optional hosted 4D steps; CLI-only green is not
compiled-host green.

For this destination, **Actions → Release compiled component → Run workflow**
has Boolean `validation_only`, default **true**. Validation builds the selected
immutable `github.sha` through the native matrix and signed-package checks,
requires neither an existing version tag nor `FOURD_ENABLED`, and cannot
publish. Section 8 defines the signed artifact gates; ordinary CI's optional
4D switch does not disable this validation path.

The production path (`validation_only:false` for dispatch) requires
`version_tag`, an **already existing** `v<SemVer>` tag matching the initialized
repository's `template.json.version` / `package.json.version`. It creates no
tag. The gate resolves/peels that tag to a commit SHA, validates source at that
SHA, and all reusable native CI, assembly, compilation and publication jobs use
that exact SHA—not the selected UI branch. Packaging receives the normalized
tag explicitly. Publication refreshes and verifies the tag has not moved, uses
`--verify-tag`, and remains blocked by compilation or final host failure.
Do not manually dispatch publication or create a tag without user permission.
This destination-specific contract supersedes the inherited unsigned release
instructions; it does not authorize a dispatch, tag creation, publication or merge.

## 7. Report evidence, not assumptions

Use a per-check status matrix. `passed` means **executed successfully for the
identified revision/artifact/platform**. `not_run` means no execution evidence;
it never means passed, waived or release ready. Report `failed` for an executed
failure and attach the command/reason. Preserve blocked/unsupported explanations
without converting them into a success.
The helper's JSON statuses are strictly `passed` / `failed` / `not_run`.

| Check | Evidence required for `passed` | Typical local limitation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python / icon checks | Exact command and result | Does not prove 4D loading |
| Native CLI per target | Execution on that OS/architecture | Cross-built targets remain `not_run` for native execution |
| Source 4D host | Fresh host report and actual namespaced calls | Only the observed native host |
| 4D compilation | Fresh success, targets/project and input digest | Not host/package acceptance |
| ZIP/package integrity | Names, source stripping, modes, explicit directories, libraries | Not runtime loading |
| Compiled 4D host | Unpacked artifact, fresh report, compiled mode true | Intel/Windows 4D remain separate checks |
| Dependency-manager install | Actual published asset download/load | Manual local install is not this check |
| Signing/notarization | Final signed artifact checks and Accepted notarization | Required for this destination's signed pipeline; unsigned local checks remain separate |

Summarize revision/input digest, language, tool versions/platform, exact commands,
artifact/report paths and unvalidated checks. Never describe an Apple Silicon
local package as fully cross-platform accepted. Partial acceptance is **NOT
release ready**; publication requires all mandatory gates. Signing is not
required for generic unsigned local acceptance, but is mandatory for this
destination's signed release pipeline.
Report the **actual** compiler used: Go **1.25.1** was available in the local
November 1 observation, whereas **1.26.10** is the CI pin and the source minimum
is 1.23. Do not relabel a local 1.25.1 build as a 1.26.10 build.

### UUID adoption case study — November 1, 2026

[miyako/UuidTest](https://github.com/miyako/UuidTest) is an actual destination
created from this template, not a rename of the original template repository.
Its exact repository/component/project/catalog/package case is `UuidTest`;
namespace also happens to be `UuidTest`, but that is a choice, **not an equality
requirement**. CLI `uuid-test` and feature class `UUIDv7` are independent.
See its [documented local acceptance](https://github.com/miyako/UuidTest#build-and-local-acceptance),
[feature class](https://github.com/miyako/UuidTest/blob/main/component/UuidTest/Documentation/Classes/UUIDv7.md)
and [RFC 9562 §5.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9562.html#section-5.7).
Exact evidence: [miyako/UuidTest#1](https://github.com/miyako/UuidTest/pull/1),
[hosted CLI run](https://github.com/miyako/UuidTest/actions/runs/41263891932),
and [template scalar/lipo fixes #2](https://github.com/miyako/4d-component-template/pull/2).

The example replaced greetings with Go stdlib-only UUIDv7 generation and updated
the API, CLI tests, native smoke tests and real source/compiled host fixture.
It exercised free tool4d 20.7/101905 on Apple Silicon, same-source Go cross
artifacts, universal assembly and source-stripped package loading. Lessons:
initializer text is description-only; rename does not implement UUIDs; scalar
guards and strict NUL search matter in real 4D; lipo argument order and explicit
ZIP directories matter; Go runtime notices still need redistribution.
Fresh subprocess randomness is not monotonic across calls, and a collision
sample is not a uniqueness proof. Its reported local success does not prove
Windows 4D, native Intel 4D, dependency-manager downloads or signing. The cited
hosted run separately passed native macOS Intel/ARM and Windows CLI jobs with
Go 1.26.10; local Rosetta CLI execution is a different observation. A 10,000-item
same-millisecond no-duplicate sample was empirical evidence, not a mathematical
guarantee. These links describe a dated observation, not a substitute for
rerunning the destination's acceptance or a promise about future repository state.

### Definition of done and final evidence

For a requested local implementation, finish the feature, replace every
greeting-specific surface, run exact feature/error tests, validate licenses and
resources, compile fresh, and load the **exact final ZIP's** unpacked component.
Report unsupported/unavailable checks as `not_run`; local success remains
`release_ready:false`. Approved publication additionally requires the existing
matching tag, all required native artifact/tests, hosted 4D opt-in and the final
package-host gate plus the destination-specific signing/notarization gates in
section 8. Generic local unsigned acceptance remains a separate path.

The final handoff must identify the repository/namespace/class/CLI/language,
revision and input provenance, exact commands/results, tool versions, stable ZIP
path plus SHA256, adjacent evidence JSON and a per-platform status matrix.
Use the helper's actual `steps`, `artifact`, `finished`, `result` and
`release_ready` fields rather than inventing a success summary:

```json
{
  "result": "partial",
  "finished": true,
  "release_ready": false,
  "artifact": {"path": "dist/NAME.zip", "sha256": "<actual SHA256>"},
  "steps": {
    "source_host": {"status": "passed"},
    "compiled_host": {"status": "passed"},
    "windows_4d": {"status": "not_run", "reason": "runtime unavailable"}
  }
}
```

This is an abbreviated shape; replace `NAME` and hash with observed values,
retain the helper's actual positive byte count and all real rows. Never label a missing runtime, finite sample,
cross-build or optional skipped workflow as passed.

| Symptom | Deterministic next check / stop criterion |
| --- | --- |
| Undefined namespaced constructor / Object expected | Compare actual XML namespace, class filename and host `cs.<namespace>.<class>`; ensure original fixtures were not copied over initialized files. Read phase/raw host errors. |
| Permission denied / Not a directory at launch | Distinguish expected non-executable negative probe from a real failure. Verify executable bit and File constructor path kind; Python macOS paths are POSIX, not `.platformPath`. Never fall back to PATH or a shell. |
| Compile exits zero but no success JSON | Stop: inspect fresh `build/compile-status.json` and compiler diagnostics; exit code alone is insufficient. |
| Stale input/output SHA256 | Rebuild all affected CLI targets, assemble, clear DerivedData through the compiler helper, recompile and retest. Never edit the marker to match. |
| Compiled loader crash / interpreted package | Verify explicit nested ZIP directory records, external native Libraries, source stripping and exact `Is compiled mode`; keep the established packer. |
| Tool download/checksum/config failure | Check `package.json.tool` or complete overrides, official fixed URL and independently approved SHA256; do not fall back to `latest`, bypass the hash or redistribute vendor tools. |
| Final host unfinished/failed | Stop and preserve status/phase/errors. A previous ZIP, successful compile or six completed cases cannot approve this run. |

## 8. Icons, licensing and destination signing

The committed `component/<name>/Resources/logo.png` and `logo.svg` are the
**source of truth**; custom hand-made artwork is kept as-is and is never required
to byte-match generator output. `python3 scripts/validate_icons.py` only checks
that `logo.png` is a real PNG (signature plus valid IHDR) and `logo.svg` is
well-formed XML with an SVG `<svg>` root. `scripts/generate_icons.py` is an
optional bootstrap that rasterizes `assets/icon-source.svg` only when **both**
icons are missing; it never overwrites an existing icon. Never rename SVG to PNG.

The scaffold is MIT; retain its copyright/license. Review all bundled tools,
static libraries and language runtimes separately and include required notices
in `Resources/licenses/`. Vendor tool4d is separately licensed and not bundled.
No third-party feature algorithm/artwork should be copied without license review.
The initializer copies the selected Go BSD / Rust MIT baseline notice from
`cli-starters/<language>/licenses/` to component `Resources/licenses/`; the
packer requires it. The Go notice was checked against Go 1.25.1 and the CI pin
1.26.10; the Rust MIT option against Rust 1.99.1. These are **not** blanket
licenses for every dependency/runtime exception. Review the Rust distribution's
`COPYRIGHT-library.html` and include applicable third-party notices; review
Microsoft static-CRT redistribution terms for Windows C++. Additional DLLs,
dylibs, statically linked dependencies and copied code need their own notices.
Never claim this deterministic file-presence check is a legal audit.

### Destination-specific signed release contract

Signing implementation is authorized for `miyako/spooler-monitor` through
`scripts/sign_release.py` and the existing `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
These destination instructions supersede the template's historical unsigned
release/seven-secret guidance. They do **not** authorize publication, tag
creation or merge in the current task. Production remains an immutable
existing-tag path with `FOURD_ENABLED=true`; validation-only dispatch defaults
to true, uses the selected immutable `github.sha`, needs no existing tag or
`FOURD_ENABLED`, and cannot publish.

Signing is not a prerequisite for the generic unsigned local
development/package acceptance path or the free compiler. No local credentials
are required. Gatekeeper/quarantine may still block unsigned downloads; never
add a runtime trust bypass.

#### Six registered Actions secrets

The six values below are already registered in this destination repository.
Template creation does not inherit secrets or variables. Keep private values
in Actions **Secrets** only; never place certificates/private keys/passwords
in source, workflow YAML, logs, package metadata or a PR.

| Repository Actions secret | Exact value/type |
| --- | --- |
| `APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_CERTIFICATE` | Base64 of an exported **Developer ID Application `.p12` including its private key**. Export identity and private key together from Keychain Access; a public `.cer`, PEM certificate or filename alone is insufficient. |
| `APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | The password chosen for that `.p12` export; not an Apple account or temporary keychain password. |
| `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` | An arbitrary strong randomly generated password for a temporary workflow keychain, independent of account passwords. |
| `NOTARYTOOL_APPLE_ID` | The Apple account **email address** authorized to notarize for the Developer team. |
| `NOTARYTOOL_TEAM_ID` | The Apple Developer **Team ID** for the signing identity and notarization account. |
| `NOTARYTOOL_PASSWORD` | An Apple **app-specific password** for notarization, **not the normal Apple account login password**. |

`CODESIGN_APPLE_ID` is **not required**. Import into an isolated temporary
keychain, derive exactly one valid **Developer ID Application** signing
identity with its private key, and verify its team against
`NOTARYTOOL_TEAM_ID`. Reject missing, multiple, invalid or wrong-team
identities rather than selecting an arbitrary identity from the host.
Delete the temporary keychain on success and **every failure**, including
partial setup/import, signing, notarization and verification failures. Do not
use or export credentials from a developer's login keychain.

#### Immutable inputs, staged signing and final-byte evidence

1. Build/test all three native targets from the same immutable resolved ref.
   Validate native pre-sign manifests during assembly; require real source
   host execution, fresh real compilation and strict input/output digest
   marker validation before packaging an unsigned intermediate.
2. Unpack that intermediate into a **separate staged compiled `.4dbase`**.
   Sign only the universal macOS CLI and the generated `Libraries` Mach-O
   dylib, with hardened runtime and secure timestamp, **no extra
   entitlements**. Do not sign `.4DZ` or arbitrary resources.
3. Deterministically repack final `dist/spooler-monitor.zip`, preserving the
   original `.4DZ` bytes, Windows executable bytes and every non-code resource,
   explicit nested ZIP directory records and executable modes. Source/build
   manifests and `compile-status.json` stay unchanged as **pre-sign**
   provenance. Signed final hashes are separate; never rewrite a digest
   marker or native manifest to bless modified signed output.
4. Submit the **final ZIP** to `notarytool` and require `Accepted`, failing
   closed on submission/rejection/verification errors. Strictly verify code
   signatures, expected team, secure timestamp and hardened runtime on
   **every architecture** of both Mach-O files. Report the CLI and dylib
   signatures separately; CLI success is not dylib evidence.
5. Perform online Gatekeeper CLI assessment only if the actual installed tool
   supports that assessment. Record command/output and unsupported checks
   truthfully as `not_run`; do not infer a Gatekeeper pass from `codesign` or
   notary acceptance.
6. Load the **exact final ZIP's unpacked component after signing** in a real
   4D host and require fresh compiled-mode success. Do not substitute the
   source tree, unsigned intermediate or earlier host report.
7. Record final signed-byte inventory and report in
   `dist/spooler-monitor.signing.json`, bound to the final ZIP SHA256,
   original unsigned ZIP SHA256 and original native pre-sign manifests.
   Preserve the report and final ZIP together; inspect actual evidence before
   claiming any signing, notary, Gatekeeper or host check passed.

ZIPs, bare CLI executables and dylibs cannot be stapled. This layout relies on
Apple **online ticket lookup**, not an offline stapled guarantee. Do not invent
an arbitrary DMG or claim an offline ticket is attached to these artifacts.

Current signing, notarization, online Gatekeeper and exact final signed-ZIP
host evidence is **`not_run`**; no successful notary submission is claimed by
these instructions or by secret registration. Preserve distinct limitations:
native Intel/Windows 4D loading, live queue mutations and published
dependency-manager installation remain `not_run` unless actually executed.
Unsigned local partial acceptance remains `release_ready:false` and cannot
approve the signed production path.

Keep public compiler pins/hosted opt-in under package metadata and Actions
**Variables**, not Secrets. GitHub supplies the restricted publish job's
`GITHUB_TOKEN`; no additional personal-token secret is needed.
